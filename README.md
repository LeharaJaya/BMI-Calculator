# BMI-Calculator
The program prompts the user to enter their weight and height.
It then calculates the BMI by dividing the weight by the square of the height.
The BMI result is displayed to the user, along with health feedback based on the result.
Example:
yaml
Copy code
Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Your BMI is: 22.86
You have a normal weight.
This is a basic implementation, but you can enhance it by adding more features, such as:

Handling different units (e.g., pounds and inches).
Allowing multiple users to calculate their BMI at once.
Adding a GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX.
